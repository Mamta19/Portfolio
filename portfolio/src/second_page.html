                <P>Hi, Again! Here you will find my interests, hobbies, passions and professions. Let's begin with the most
                    interesting matter -- my interests. Click on the link and you will find what gets me excited and brightens
                    my day each day everyday. <br> Do I love to plant trees and care for them? I cannot wait to answer yes
                    to this question. It's no bragging but I have been told by so many that I am born with green fingers.
                    I guess it's the time and energy I put into my yard that makes it so lush green that it feels the
                    grass is telling me "we want to be here." I do believe that plants do understand our emotions and feel
                    our love just like our babies and our pets even though they can't tell us that. Little wonder Spring
                    is my favorite season.

                                I have learned many recipes and take ultimate pleasure in cooking for my family and friends.
                                My husband and my boys find so much joy during winter nibbling on their favorite Indian snacks.</p>
